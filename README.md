In this lab we will train a state of the art image classifier using and CV Studio, CV Studio is a fast, easy and collaborative open source image annotation tool for teams and individuals. In practice, very few people train an entire Convolutional Network from scratch (with random initialization), because it is relatively rare to have a dataset of sufficient size. Instead, it is common to pretrain a ConvNet on a very large dataset in the lab, then use this Network to train our model. We will use the Convolutional Network as a feature generator, only training the output layer. In general, 100-200 images will be used
